## Usage
### setup authentication

Login using `asp_login()`. Before logging in: You can pass in your username and password to the function. We strongly recommend not doing that though, and instead storing your credentials as environment variables, that are then read in within the package like `Sys.getenv('ARCHIVESPACE_USER')`. Store two env vars in your `.Renviron` file (create it if you don't have one): `ARCHIVESPACE_USER` and `ARCHIVESPACE_PWD`. You can alternatively use R options that are stored in your `.Rprofile` file as `archivespace_user` and `archivespace_pwd`, but env vars are preferred. You can
optionally set env vars during the R session by running `Sys.setenv(ARCHIVESPACE_USER = 'your user name')` and
`Sys.setenv(ARCHIVESPACE_PWD = 'your password')`, or similarly with R options like
`options(archivespace_user = 'your user name')` and
`options(archivespace_pwd = 'your password')` - but these only last for the
current R session.

You can logout with `asp_logout()`
